## Key Components

- **CreateInvoice**: Main component for creating and editing invoices
- **Preview**: Renders a real-time preview of the current invoice
- **Sidebar**: Contains form inputs for invoice details
- **ViewInvoices**: Displays a list of all invoices with sorting and filtering options
- **DataTable**: Reusable table component for displaying invoice data

## State Management

The application uses Zustand for state management. The main store is defined in `src/store/invoiceStore.ts` and includes actions for creating, updating, and managing invoices.

## Email Functionality

The app uses EmailJS for sending invoices directly via email. Here's how it works:

1. Set up EmailJS account and obtain credentials (Service ID, Template ID, User ID).
2. Store credentials in `.env.local` file.
3. Use the `sendInvoiceEmail` function in `src/lib/sendInvoiceEmail.ts`:

```typescript
export async function sendInvoiceEmail(invoice: InvoiceFormValues, htmlContent: string): Promise<void> {
  // EmailJS configuration and sending logic
}
```

4. Call this function when sending an invoice:

```typescript
const htmlContent = renderToStaticMarkup(<EmailPreview currentInvoice={currentInvoice} />);
await sendInvoiceEmail(currentInvoice, htmlContent);
```

The email content is generated using the `EmailPreview` component, which creates an HTML representation of the invoice.

## Customization

- **Currencies**: Add or modify currencies in `src/constants/currencies.ts`
- **Invoice Template**: Customize the invoice layout in the `Preview` component
- **Styling**: Modify the Tailwind CSS classes or update `tailwind.config.js` for global style changes
